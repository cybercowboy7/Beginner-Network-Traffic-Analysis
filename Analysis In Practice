Descriptive Analysis:

- Describes a data set based on individual characteristics. It helps detect possible error in data collection and/or outliers in the data set

- What is the issue?
    - Suspected breach?
    - Networking Issue?

- Define our scope and the goal. (What are we looking for? Which time period?)
    - Target: multiple hosts potentially downloading a malicious file from bad.example.com
    - When: Within the last 48 hours + 2 hours from now
    - Supporting info: Filenames/types 'superbad.exe' 'new-crypto-miner.exe'

- Define our target(s) (net / hosts / protocol)
    - Scope: 192.168.100.0/24 network, protocols used were HTTP and FTP


Diagnostic Analysis:

- Clarifies the causes, effectsm and interactions of conditions. 

- Capture network traffic:
    - Plug into a link with access to the 192.168.100.0/24 network to capture live traffic 
    to try and grab one of the executables in transfer. See if an admin can pull PCAP and/or 
    netflow data from our SIEM for the historical data.

- Identification of required network traffic components (filtering):
    - Once we have traffic, filter out any packets not needed for this investigation to include; 
    any traffic that matches our common baseline and keep anything relevant to the scope of the 
    investigation. For example, HTTP and FTP from the subnet, anything transferring or containing 
    a GET request for the suspected executable files.

- An understanding of captured network traffic:
    - Once we have filtered out the noise, it is time to dig for our targets—filter on things like 
    ftp-data to find any files transferred and reconstruct them. For HTTP, we can filter on 
    http.request.method == "GET" to see any GET requests that match the filenames we are searching for. 
    This can show us who has acquired the files and potentially other transfers internal to the network 
    on the same protocols.


Predictive Analysis:

- Creates a predictive model for future probabilities. 

- Makes it possible to ID trends, detect deviations from expected values at an early stage, and predict future 
occurrences as accurately as possible.

- Note-taking and mind mapping of the found results:
    - Annotating everything we do, see, or find throughout the investigation is crucial. Ensure we are taking ample notes, including:
        - Timeframes we captured traffic during.
        - Suspicious hosts within the network.
        - Conversations containing the files in question. ( to include timestamps and packet numbers)

- Summary of the analysis (what did we find?):
    - Finally, summarize what we have found explaining the relevant details so that superiors can decide to quarantine the affected 
    hosts or perform more significant incident response.

    - Our analysis will affect decisions made, so it is essential to be as clear and concise as possible.

What is the issue?
Suspected breach? Networking issue?

Define our scope and the goal (what are we looking for? which time period?)
target: multiple hosts potentially downloading a malicious file from bad.example.com
when: within the last 48 hours + 2 hours from now.
supporting info: filenames/types 'superbad.exe' 'new-crypto-miner.exe'

Define our target(s) (net / host(s) / protocol)
scope: 192.168.100.0/24 network protocols used were HTTP and FTP.

Capture network traffic
plug into a link with access to the 192.168.100.0/24 network to capture live traffic to try and grab one of the executables in transfer. 
See if an admin can pull PCAP and/or netflow data from our SIEM for the historical data.

Identification of required network traffic components (filtering)
once we have traffic, filter out any traffic not needed for this investigation to include; any traffic that matches our common baseline 
and keep anything relevant to the scope. `HTTP and FTP from the subnet, anything transferring or containing a GET request for the suspected executable files.

An understanding of captured network traffic

For HTTP, we can filter on http.request.method == "GET" to see any GET requests that match the filenames we are searching for. This can show us who has

Summary of the analysis (what did we find?)
Finally, summarize what has been found, explaining the relevant details so that superiors can make an informed decision to quarantine the affected hosts or perform more significant incident response.
