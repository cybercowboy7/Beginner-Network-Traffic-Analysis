Network Traffic Analysis (NTA):

  - Everyday use cases:
    - Collecting real-time traffic within the network to analyze upcoming threats
    - Setting a baseline for day-to-day network communications
    - Identifying and analyzing traffic from non-standard ports, suspicious hosts, and issues with networking protocols such as HTTP errors, problems with TCP, or other network misconfigs
    - Detecting malware on the wire, such as ransomware, exploits, and non-standard interactions
    - NTA is also useful when investigating past incidents and during threat hunting

Common Traffic Analysis Tools

  - tcpdump:
    - tcpdump is a command-line utility that, with the aid of LibPcap, captures and interprets network traffic from a network interface or capture file.

  - Tshark:
    - TShark is a network packet analyzer much like TCPDump. It will capture packets from a live network or read and decode from a file. It is the command-line variant of Wireshark.

  - Wireshark:
    - Wireshark is a graphical network traffic analyzer. It captures and decodes frames off the wire and allows for an in-depth look into the environment. It can run many different dissectors 
    against the traffic to characterize the protocols and applications and provide insight into what is happening.

  - NGrep:
    - NGrep is a pattern-matching tool built to serve a similar function as grep for Linux distributions. The big difference is that it works with network traffic packets. NGrep understands 
    how to read live traffic or traffic from a PCAP file and utilize regex expressions and BPF syntax. This tool shines best when used to debug traffic from protocols like HTTP and FTP.

  - tcpick:
    - tcpick is a command-line packet sniffer that specializes in tracking and reassembling TCP streams. The functionality to read a stream and reassemble it back to a file with tcpick is excellent.

  - Network Taps:
    - Taps (Gigamon, Niagra-taps) are devices capable of taking copies of network traffic and sending them to another place for analysis. These can be in-line or out of band. They can actively capture 
    and analyze the traffic directly or passively by putting the original packet back on the wire as if nothing had changed.
