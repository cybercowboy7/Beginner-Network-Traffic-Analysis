TCPDump Filters:

host	                  host will filter visible traffic to show anything involving the designated host. Bi-directional
src / dest	            src and dest are modifiers. We can use them to designate a source or destination host or port.
net	                    net will show us any traffic sourcing from or destined to the network designated. It uses / notation.
proto	                  will filter for a specific protocol type. (ether, TCP, UDP, and ICMP as examples)
port	                  port is bi-directional. It will show any traffic with the specified port as the source or destination.
portrange	              portrange allows us to specify a range of ports. (0-1024)
less / greater "< >"	  less and greater can be used to look for a packet or protocol option of a specific size.
and / &&	              and && can be used to concatenate two different filters together. for example, src host AND port.
or	                    or allows for a match on either of two conditions. It does not have to meet both. It can be tricky.
not	                    not is a modifier saying anything but x. For example, not UDP.


Examples:

  Host Filter
  ### Syntax: host [IP]
  sudo tcpdump -i eth0 host 172.16.146.2

  Source/Destination Filter
  ### Syntax: src/dst [host|net|port] [IP|Network Range|Port]
  sudo tcpdump -i eth0 src host 172.16.146.2

  Using Destination in Combination with the Net Filter
  sudo tcpdump -i eth0 dest net 172.16.146.0/24

  Protocol Filter - Common Name:
  ### Syntax: [tcp/udp/icmp]
  sudo tcpdump -i eth0 udp

  Protocol Filter Number:
  ### Syntax: proto [protocol number]
  sudo tcpdump -i eth0 proto 17

  Port Range Filter:
  ### Syntax: portrange [portrange 0-65535]
  sudo tcpdump -i eth0 portrange 0-1024

  Less/Greater Filter:
  ### Syntax: less/greater [size in bytes]
  sudo tcpdump -i eth0 less 64

  AND Filter:
  ### Syntax: and [requirement]
  sudo tcpdump -i eth0 host 192.168.0.1 and port 23

  NOT Filter:
  ### Syntax: not/! [requirement]
  sudo tcpdump -r sus.pcap not icmp
