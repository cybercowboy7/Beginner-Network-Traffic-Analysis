What is it?

- CLI packet sniffer that can directly capture and interpret data frames from a file or network interface.

- Has a windows twin called WinDump

- To capture "off the wire" traffic it uses pcap and libpcap paired with an interface in promiscuous mode to listen for data.

- Must be root or admin to run the tool

Install Tcpdump:

sudo apt install tcpdump


Tcpdump Version Validation:

sudo tcpdump --version


Tcpdump Manpage:

Choosing an int. to capture from:

sudo tcpdump -D
  - Lists interfaces you can capture from 

sudo tcpdump -i eth0
  - Selects the interface eth0 to capture traffic from

sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -nn
  - Tells tcpdump to refain from resolving ip addresses and port numbers to their hostnames and common port names

sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -e
  - Telling tcpdump to include the ethernet headers in the capture's output along with its regular content

sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -X
  - Can see the packet clearer. -x gies us ASCII output on the right to interpret anything in clear text that corresponds to hex output on the left

sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -nnvXX
  - combination of known switches (best practice to utilize combination of switches)



File Input/Output with Tcpdump:

- utilize -w to write capture to a file

  sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w ~/output.pcap


Reading Output from a file

  sudo tcpdump -r ~/output.pcap
